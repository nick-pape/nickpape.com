We awoke in Westport to fresh coffee and pastries provided
by our generous hosts, and snapped a few pictures at the
"Westport Whale" which we could see from our room.

There were fewer things to do, but many vista points along
the the drive to San Francisco. Most of the drive, we
paralleled bluffs and rocky shores. We pulled off at quite
a few places, our favorite of which were the Mendocino
Headlands State Park and the Point Arena Lighthouse. The
drizzle continued most of the day.

After about a hundred miles, the road changed fairly
drastically. We drove along an extremely windy,
mountainous road. At certain points, we had ascended
over 1,200 feet and were just inches away from a huge
dropoff. Needless to say, it was slow going -- we rarely
got above 35 MPH. However, the views were spectacular
(again). At some points, you could see up to 4 bends of the
road climbing and descending the hills.

Along the drive, we also noticed a few places with
endearing names -- Nick's Cove and Duncan's Landing.
Nick's Cove was just a restaurant and Duncan's Landing
was a state park.

From there, we headed inland a bit. After passing Nick's
Cove, we entered a very interesting area. The rolling hills
and farms provided a scenic change. We felt
like we were in England, Germany, or the Northeast.
We even passed through a town that we swore was in the
movie Beetlejuice.

Arriving at the Golden Gate Bridge was a huge reward at the end
of the day. San Francisco was the first place we had planned
to spend an extra day sightseeing. We checked into our hotel
and headed to Coit Tower. We climbed up hundreds of steps
and were a little disappointed when we arrived at the Tower,
as it had just closed moments before.

We checked into the hotel and did a little pub crawl through
the area nearby. Hence why there was no post yesterday!

Today we slept in slightly, drinking lots of water and coffee.
We were really excited to see what San Francisco had to offer.
First, we headed to Chinatown to collect our penny and eat
some noodles. Nick was a little afraid of most of the places
there, but we ended up finding a small dim sum place to snack.

Then we walked over to the Cable Car Museum. It was fascinating
to learn that a single station powers all the cable cars in
the city through a series of underground cables.

Then we paralleled one of the cable car routes up
to Fisherman's
Wharf, where we strolled along the waterfront, checking out
the various shops and sights. Our favorite stop was seeing the
sea lions on Pier 39!

We ubered back to the hotel and drove over to the Marin
Headlands Viewpoint, where we were treated to an amazing
view of the city and the Golden Gate Bridge (as well as
the headlands to the Northwest). We learned the army had
started building a series of bunkers there, but stopped
after the advent of aviation in war, as the fortifications
would not be effective against aircraft.

After, we headed to Palo Alto to meet my brother, Noah,
for dinner. Along the way, we detoured through the Golden Gate
Park (which is a super fantastic park) and the Haight-Ashbury
District (where all the hippies came during the Summer of
Love).

We met Noah at his dorm and headed to a restaurant Guy Fieri
had eaten at. We both got delicious pastrami burgers. It was
good to see him -- he just got back from Tahoe and is heading
to England to study abroad in the fall.

Tomorrow we are going to continue our drive down the 1 and
hopefully make it to San Luis Obispo, CA! Then onwards to
Hollywood (where we may just stop our trip and try to make
it as movie stars). Just kidding.

Thanks for reading and being patient!
