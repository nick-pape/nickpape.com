We got an early start again and headed
up to Mesa Verde National Park, which
has some really cool ancient cliff 
dwellings that you tour. In the summer.
In the winter, you can only drive a
45-minute loop to take a picture from the
hillside. So we skipped it, sadly.

We stopped at 4 Corners. Nick put limbs
in 4 different states at same time.

We also got a Navajo Taco that wasn't
very good.

The detour for Mesa Verde had set us 
behind schedule slightly, so we ended
up having to drive over 500 miles.
We have to say, the scenery
 was a little repetitive and boring.


One highlight however, was the Bisti 
Badlands. This area used to be a mighty
river delta, which carved some really
cool features into the landscape.
We saw some pieces of petrified wood
and several different types of rocks.
The ground was also covered in a 
salty/chalky white substance, which
was strange.

At some points along the drive, it
looked like we were in a plains region,
but then you could see where the river
delta had cut through the land millions
of years ago.

We drove through a large Native American
reservation, and were a bit saddened to
see the amount of litter on the side of
the road -- which wasn't something we
hadn't seen at all driving down the 
coast.

We stopped at a Fuddrucker's because 
Katie had never been there and she had
been intrigued by the name when we were
in Austin last. It was pretty good, but
sadly they had removed the games.

The last part of the drive into 
Alamogordo was fairly boring as it
was at night. And we were in New Mexico.

The main highlight was the Holloman Air
Force Base, which was the location of
the Trinity test (the first explosion of
a nuclear weapon).

Tomorrow we have a packed day. We want
to see Pistachioland, White Sands, 
Roswell, and Carlsbad Caverns. Hopefully
the post for tomorrow will be written 
from Texas.

Today was the first day we realized
our trip will be coming to an end soon,
which has made us really sad. This has 
been a really fun trip for both of us.
Luckily, we still have that 2nd drive,
so we will get to see even more!
