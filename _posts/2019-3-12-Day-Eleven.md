We got started early and headed straight
for the San Diego Zoo. The Zoo is one
of the highest rated in the world, 
and houses over 650 species of animals.

We didn't take a bunch of pictures inside
the zoo, however. It was usually a bit
difficult to get good shots, and Katie
and I preferred to just watch and enjoy
the animals.

Our favorites animals were the orangutans,
the sun bear, a dog and cheetah who had become
friends, and the polar bear.

We also got to ride another gondola over the zoo,
which was neat.

It was getting late, so we picked up some burritos
at Lucha Libre Taco Shop. Mmmmm.

The next stop was Joshua Tree, which was a little out
of the way, but was totally worth it. We arrived
near sunset and were able to watch it from the park.
There are a TON of these strange Joshua Trees, which have
limbs that look like they were designed by a computer
algorithm. It was really impressive and we really want
to go back and camp there some day.

We drove in the dark through the Mojave desert,
with our GPS taking us on strange dirt roads and
other roads that had a TON of dips.

Actually driving into Vegas was intense. You could
see the lights of the city reflected in the sky from
80 miles away, and (because it is so flat), you could see
neon casino signs for miles and miles away.

We checked into MGM Grand and...
