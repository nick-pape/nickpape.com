Natually, we got a late start leaving Vegas
and didn't make it quite as far as we
wanted.

**Katie's Perspective Follows...**

We wanted to camp in the Grand Canyon,
so we stopped at Walmart for some 
supplies.
Nick argued with me about which hot dogs
to buy. (Hebrew National vs Polish Dogs).

Then we drove to the Hoover Dam, which is
really impressive. The water was down to
35% so you could see where the water had
bleached the rock. Also, the powerlines
were all tilted there.

We were also surprised that you have to
go through pretty intense security,
including being questioned by people with
bulletproof vests.

The dam lies on the Nevada-Arizona border,
so there were 2 clocks. Oddly, they are
both in the time zone, so that was weird.

The weather was great so we got some
good pictures.

So we learned you could do dispersed
camping in the Kaibab Forest south of
Grand Canyon National Park. What we
didn't realize was how to temperature
would drop drastically after sunset.

During the drive, the landscape changed
from Vegas-style desert to an area
resembling central Texas, to a forest
covered in snow. 

It was 24 degrees out and Nick excitedly
started setting up camp. The area was
covered in snow, which made it quiet
and eery. When the wind blew, snow would
fall from trees and it sounded like bears
coming to eat us.

In the 24 DEGREE WEATHER, Nick decided
that we only needed a charcoal fire.
*Some Boy Scout...* Let me repeat,
a charcoal campfire.

We barely had enough heat to roast the 
weenies and they tasted like chemicals.

Nick finally got cold and gave in. After
spending 2 hours in the freezing snow,
we headed for the nearest motel where
we slept soundly. And warmly.
