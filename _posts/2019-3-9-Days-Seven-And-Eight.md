We were awake relatively early on Friday and began our drive.
First stop was Half Moon Bay, which my brother, Noah, had
said was really nice. We drove over to a Ritz Carlton with
a nice gold course and public access to the ocean and admired
the scenery. Both Katie and I decided we wanted to stay there
at some point in the future as they had private gas burning
outdoor firepits.

Next stop was the Pigeon Point Lighthouse, which apparently
also has an HI Hostel attached to it. It was very scenic
and we were able to get super close to the lighthouse itself.

We made a quick stop at Greyhound Rock, which we guess is named
after the dog breed. It was a little boring - just a big flat
rock.

After, we drove into Santa Cruz, CA, the namesake of the
famous clothing line and home to UC-SC. They had a nice
wharf that we walked on and ended up eating some fish tacos
and a crab sandwhich. They also had some sea lions that were
napping right next to our picnic location. One of our favorite
parts was the $1 parking.

Monterey Bay is an extremely pretty area. We really want
to go back.

![](/assets/images/day7/Viewpoint.jpg)

After Santa Cruz, the next place we stopped was Cannery Row
in Monterey, CA. It seemed like a good spot to spend a weekend.
There were lots of wine tastings, cheese places, a salsa place,
and a few candy shops. We did a quick wine tasting and ended
up enjoying it so much we took home a bottle. We also picked
up some ice cream!

![](/assets/images/day7/Monterey.jpg)

We kept driving to Moss Landing viewing point, where, after a
few minutes of searching, we spotted several sea otters 
floating in the water. They are surprisingly cute. It was
nearly impossible to get Katie back in the car after seeing
these little critters.

Our favorite stop of the day was the Calla Lily Valley and the
surrounding beach area. With a small hike, you can get into the
valley and see the creek where a bunch of Calla Lily
flowers grow. These flowers are white and traditionally a 
funeral flower. The beach area was amazing. The stream was
constantly eroding away the sand that had been pushed up
during low tide - forming some "sand cliffs" that were several
feet high. We walked along the beach and admired it for a 
while. The sand was also amazing, it was quite large!

It was getting dark, so we pulled over and had our dinner 
sandwhiches on a cliff somewhere after Big Sur. We could
hear sea lions while we are (again)!

By this time it was dark and we couldn't find anywhere cheap
to stay in the area, so we continued on to San Luis Obispo,
a small college town midway between LA and SF.

![](/assets/images/day7/Gumwall.jpg)

We ended up going out, but struggled to find places that 
weren't either super clubby, super busy, or filled with
college students. We finally did at the end of the night, 
though!

The next day, we got a bit of a late start, so we decided
to stop a little less often. We first stopped at Pismo Beach
and collected a penny while walking around the beach, 
videochatting Katie's mom.

![](/assets/images/day7/Pismo.jpg)

We tried to visit Vandenburg Air Force Base, where SpaceX 
launches its rockets, but I didn't consider it was an active
military base and has to tourism/information center. We were
denied entry, haha!

Katie's brother tipped us off to the small Danish town of
Solvang, CA - so we headed in that direction. The
scenery changed a bit into farms and vineyards and was
extremely pretty. We stumbled upon our favorite part of the
day: Ostrichland USA. We fed some Ostriches and continued to
Solvang.

Solvang was an interesting town. All the buildings are 
constructed in an old-fashioned Danish style - complete
with random non-functioning windmills. We walked around,
tasted some olive oils and balsamic vinegar, then grabbed
some breads from a local shop and were on our way. The valley
seemed really nice - we could have spent a while here
between the wine, cheese, oils, breads, and the picturesque 
landscape.

![](/assets/images/day7/Solvang.jpg)

Next stop was Stearns Wharf in Santa Barbara. We picked up
some In-N-Out that was delicious but totally messed up our
stomachs. We couldn't find much parking on the wharf, so we
just continued on.

Not much later, we drove through the town of Malibu, CA.
There wasn't a ton to see there. It seemed like rich people
with fancy cars and lots of fast food (odd pairing).

It was dark by the time we got into LA, so we headed up to 
Griffith Observatory. We admired the lights and the scale of
the city, and tried to get a picture of the Hollywood sign,
but it was too dark. It was bit of a hike, but totally worth 
it.

![](/assets/images/day7/Griffith.jpg)

Lastly, we walked along the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
There were a ton of homeless people and even more people who
were fairly boujee. We finally settled on a Mexican place, but
the kitchen had just closed so we ended up getting wings
at BWW!

Today we are planning to see other sights, like Santa Monica 
Pier and Malibu beach.
