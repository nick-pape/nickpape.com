We woke up early and drove to the Grand
Canyon Visitor Center.

The pictures don't do it justice at all.
It is really big. Really, really big.
It's also deep. Over a mile deep.
It is really big. If it was full,
it would hold around
3.57 million trillion gallons of water.
A lot of water. As much as Lake Michigan.

We drove over to a neat watchtower that
looked old, but we found out it was just
a fake facade over a steel building.
So we didn't climb it.

We stopped at a view vantage points,
including Moran. At Moran, people were
climbing past the guardrails and directly
onto the cliffs. We heard one person say
"this must be why they call it Moron
viewpoint."

We were hungry and spotted a MacAlister's
randomly at a gas station in the desert.
Katie had never had it before, so we 
stopped. It was delicous.

After leaving the Grand Canyon area,
we were still surrounded by tons of
plateaus - the most famous of which
are in the Oljato-Monument Valley.

Forrest Gump (Nick's Hero) ran here once,
so we stopped and recreated the scene.

Next stop was 4 Corners, but it was closed.

We thought we would head to Mesa Verde
National Park the next day, so we stopped
in the little town of Cortez, Colorado.

We got some Mexican food and went to
Goldie's Trophy Room. It was interesting.
Everybody seemed to know everybody.
There was a guy who simultaneously
wanted to be a professional video gamer,
while also referring to Cortez as the
city of broken dreams. We watched a guy
get arrested, but then somehow he wound
up there later in the evening. He was
also from Spokane, WA -- small world...
At the end of the night there was a bar
brawl and Katie made me send our GPS
coordinates to my mom. Yeah. Interesting
night. We aren't planning on going back
to Cortez anytime soon.
